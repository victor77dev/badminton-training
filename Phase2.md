# Phase 2

We learnt the basics in previous weeks. Of course, we need to keep practicing the basics. But we can add more footwork practice.

## Key Ideas
- It's still focusing on doing it right
- Right is more than fast, so no rush when practicing
- Focus on footwork

## Plan
### Wednesday session
1. Short session
2. Repeat basic practice
3. I could help with checking
4. Our session will be after Ajay's one

### Sunday session
1. Longer session
2. Warm up exercise (~12 min)
3. Warm up with basic clear and steps in 10 min
4. Footwork exercise with throwing shuttles
5. Drops with feeding shuttles
6. Single shuttle multi rally, drop (feeder) <-> footwork
