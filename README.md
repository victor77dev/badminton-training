Hi everyone, thanks for all your interest.
Let me give you a brief understanding about the training I planned.

## Background
I bought some online courses from a former Malaysian national player. Therefore, I re-learning the basics and happy to share with you. That also means the movement and swing are something I repeat from the course and I'm still learning it.

FYI, here is where I found out him https://space.bilibili.com/519050265/. There are some simple version that you could look at if you understand Mandarin. If not, I will anyway tell you what I learn from the complete course. 

## Idea
It's all about clear and drop. We will spend months to learn and correct the movement. It might take a long time and in between you might not be able to normally (at least from my own experience, it might take weeks or months to transform to a better form). The training might be boring, but I am sure you will be benefit from it. This training is also trying to bring in habit of training in club and offer beginner level training (different from those Fadi and Ajay)

## Plan
We will go with the following steps
1. I will show you the final form of the movement.
2. Try to play some clear. Record it and look at it to find out the problem
3. I will show the break down steps according to the level each of you are in (so some of you might be some steps ahead, but at the end all are heading to the same goal)
4. Be patient and repeat the same movement a lot
Then after that you will better and you can check the advance level training from Fadi and Ajay

Good luck and have funüòâ
